Text version:

Hello everyone!
My name is Vadim, I am 25 years old. I was born and raised in Vitebsk, Belarus.

After school, I entered the university, studied for 5 years, received a diploma of an automation engineer.
I didn't feel much interest in this specialty, I just did it right according to a public template.
The next stage of my life was the assignment to required work after graduation.

I got to an old undeveloped factory, felt this field of activity and understood for myself, that it was not mine.

Next, I was lucky enough to learn about programming and specifically the JavaScript language.
During studying at the university, I came across educational works on Python and Delphi, I even tried to study python, but I quit this case.
And Some time later I started my journey in learning web development.I learned from videos, websites, books and gradually came to understand how it all works.
Everything was fine, but at a certain moment, I was taken into the army and everything ended...
Returning home after army, a couple of days later I sat down at the computer again and started to continue.

I studied native js, algorithms, solved katas on codewars and then I was lucky enough to learn about RS School courses.
I signed up for the 0 stage, did a couple of tasks, but could not figure out the huge number of links in the technical task,
and work with gitHub and left the course. While the 0 stage was going on, I was practicing in my own rhythm, pulled up the moments that were
needed for the course and now it's time when the 1 stage began. I signed up for it and started giving my best.

I was making my first successes, and I got great pleasure from assignments, cross-checks, tests, structured material and interesting community
of the school. Well, now it's time to create a Self-Introduction video.

The last project I worked on was creating a clone of the Minesweeper game. The technology stack for this project was native JS, HTML, and SASS preprocessors.
The motivation for studying programming for me is the desire to get a modern, interesting job,
which I will do with great interest, constantly improve my skills and go towards my goals. I want to become a sought-after specialist in a field that has a great future.

I am a hardworking, cheerful, sociable, purposeful person with burning eyes.
In ordinary life, I love spending time with my family, sports, fishing, nature, and animals.

And finally, I want to wish all the guys who go this way - patience, success and good luck. If we don't give up, we will succeed one day.
Thanks for your attention! Bye!
